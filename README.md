# OCR-TTS
This repo contains a Reading Assistance Device Made for Visually Impaired Students with google APIs.
I have used OCR TTS functionality in this project.
Here OCR means Optical Character Recognition which is used to extract the text from Images, Pdfs, PPTs, Newspapers etc.
I have used gTTS for converting text to audio file which will be saved in users System if he wants to.
